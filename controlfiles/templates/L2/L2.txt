# AAHYWEH
# Control file for L2 (input) to L3 (output) quality control.
#
# TEMPLATE VERSION
#  To convert this template to a version that works for data output by the standard OzFlux
#  data logger program:
#   1) Replace the following place holders with values for your site:
#      <site_name> - the name of the site
#      <year>      - the year of the data
#      <latitude>  - the latitude of the site, decimal degrees
#      <longitude> - the longitude of the site, decimal degrees
#      <height>    - the height of the measurement (above ground), m
#      <depth>     - the depth of the measurement (below ground), cm for depths <= 1m, m for depths > 1m
#      <letter>    - the letter used to distinguish sensors at the same depth or height
#   2) Replace the default quality control limits (eg Lower, Upper etc) with site-specific values.
#
# DESCRIPTION OF CONTROL FILE SECTIONS
# [Files]     - contains paths and file names
# [Output]    - specifies the variables to be written to the output file
#               - 2 output lists can be specified:
#                 - "xl" defines which variables will be written to the Excel file output
#                 - "nc" defines which variables will be written to the netCDF file output
#               - if no list is specified, all variables are written out
# [Variables] - variable names and quality control keys, only those variables
#               corrected or calculated at this level need to be specified in
#               this control file.
#               Valid quality control sections are:
#                RangeCheck      - reject data outside plausible ranges
#                DiurnalCheck    - reject data outside Avg(H.h)+/-NumSd*Stdev(H.h), see below
#                ExcludeDates    - reject data outside specified date ranges
#                ExcludeHours    - reject data for give hours within a date range
#                DependencyCheck - reject data based on status of other series
#                Linear          - apply a linear correct to a specified date range
# [Plots]     - definition of time series plots
#
# DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF QUALITY CONTROL CHECKS
# [[RangeCheck]]
#     Purpose:
#         Reject data less than a lower limit or greater than an upper limit
#     Example:
#        [[[RangeCheck]]]
#            reset_qcflag = "no"/"yes"
#            Lower = "[-10]*12"
#            Upper = "[1500]*12"
#        where;
#            Lower - an expression that evaluates to a Python list of 12 values
#            Upper - an expression that evaluates to a Python list of 12 values
#            reset_qcflag - a strang that evaluates to either "no" or "yes"
#     Syntax rules for "Lower" and "Upper":
#         1) the expressions for "Lower" and "Upper" must be enclosed in double quote marks ("")
#         2) the lower and upper limit values must be enclosed in square brackets ([])
#         3) the expression must evaluate to 12 values for the lower or upper limit,
#            one for each month of the year, this can be done in 2 ways;
#            a) shorthand eg [-10]*12
#               - repeats a value of -10 for all 12 months
#            b) longhand eg [-10,-20,-30,-40,-50,-60,-60,-50,-40,-30,-20,-10]
#               - allows a separate value to be specified for each month
#     Switches:
#      reset_qcflag - when set to "yes", the range check is first applied to find the values
#                     within the range of Upper and Lower and the QC flag for these values
#                     is set to 0
#                   - this allows the user to set up a sequence of operations that result
#                     in the merging of EddyPro and PFP fluxes and the QC of the result
#                     based on the EddyPro QC flag.
#
# [[DependencyCheck]]
#     Purpose:
#         Reject data in the target series based on rejected data in precursor series.
#         The usual way to use this QC check is to apply the other QC checks to the
#         precursor series first, place the [[DependencyChecks]] key in the target
#         series section and list the precursor series in the Source key of the
#         [[DependencyCheck]].
#     Example:
#        [[[DependencyCheck]]]
#            Source     = "['Fh_EPFlag']"
#        where;
#            Source - a list of series on which the target depends.
#     Syntax rules for [[DependencyCheck]]
#         1) only 1 Source line can be specified
#         2) the list of sources must be enclosed in DOUBLE quotes (""), in square
#            brackets ([]) and with each series label enclosed in SINGLE quotes ('')
#            and separated by commas(,).
#
# [[DiurnalCheck]]
#     CAUTION:
#         This is a powerful command.  Unsupervised application can remove a great
#         deal of good data.  Use it sparingly when other methods for rejecting
#         spikes don't work.
#     Purpose:
#         Reject data outside that falls out the range Avg(H.h)+/-NumSd*Stdev(H.h
#         where Avg(H.h) is the average of all data at time H.h (eg 8.5 is 08:30)
#               Stdev(H.h) is the standard deviation of all data at time H.h
#               NumSd is the number of standard deviations either side of the mean
#               that marks the boundary between accepted and rejected data
#         Data values less than Avg(H.h)-NumSd*Stdev(H.h) and greater than Avg(H.h)+NumSd*Stdev(H.h)
#         will be rejected.
#     Example:
#        [[[DiurnalCheck]]]
#            NumSd = "[3]*12"
#     where;
#         NumSd - the number of standard deviations either side of the mean within which
#                 data must lie to be accepted
#     Syntax rules for "NumSd":
#         1) the expressions for "NumSd" must be enclosed in double quote marks ("")
#         2) the number of standard deviation values must be enclosed in square brackets ([])
#         3) the expression must evaluate to 12 values for the number of standard deviations,
#            one for each month of the year, this can be done in 2 ways;
#            a) shorthand eg [5]*12
#               - repeats a value of 5 for all 12 months
#            b) longhand eg [5,5,5,3,3,2,2,3,3,5,5,5]
#               - allows a separate value to be specified for each month
#
# [[ExcludeDates]]
#     Purpose:
#         Reject data between specified dates.
#         Multiple date ranges can be specified on separate lines but the lines must be
#         numbered sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2 etc)
#     Example:
#        [[[ExcludeDates]]]
#            0 = "['2010-01-01 00:00','2010-01-01 00:00']"
#        where;
#            0 - a unique key to identify each date range for which data is to be rejected
#     Syntax rules for date range:
#         1) each date range to be excluded must be on a separate line and must have a
#            unique key eg 0,1,2,3 etc
#         2) each date range must be enclosed in DOUBLE quote marks ("")
#         3) each date range must be enclosed in square brackets ([])
#         4) each date range must consist of a start date and an end date enclosed
#            in SINGLE quote marks ('')
#         5) the format for the dates is YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm where YYYY is the 4 digit year,
#            MM is the 2 digit month, DD is the 2 digit day of the month, HH is the 2 digit
#            hour (24 hour format) and mm is the 2 digit minute
#
# [[ExcludeHours]]
#     Purpose:
#         Reject data at specified times between the specified date range.
#         Multiple ranges can be specified on separate lines but the lines must be numbered
#         sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2, etc)
#     Example:
#        [[[ExcludeHours]]]
#            0 = "['2010-04-22 00:00','2010-07-26 23:30',['09:30','10:00','10:30']]"
#     Syntax rules for date and hour range:
#         1) each date and hour range to be excluded must be on a separate line and must have a
#            unique key eg 0,1,2,3 etc
#         2) each date and hour range must be enclosed in DOUBLE quote marks ("")
#         3) each date and hour range must be enclosed in square brackets ([])
#         4) each date and hour range must consist of;
#            a) a start date and an end date enclosed in SINGLE quote marks ('')
#            b) a list of hours enclosed in square brackets ([]) with each hour enclosed
#               in SINGLE quote marks ('') and separated by commas (,)
#         5) the format for the dates is YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm where YYYY is the 4 digit year,
#            MM is the 2 digit month, DD is the 2 digit day of the month, HH is the 2 digit
#            hour (24 hour format) and mm is the 2 digit minute
#         6) the format of the times to be rejected is HH:mm where HH is the 2 digit hour
#            (24 hour format) and mm is the 2 digit minute.
#
# [[Linear]]
#     Purpose:
#         Apply a linear correction to the data within a date range.
#         Multiple ranges can be specified on separate lines but the lines must be numbered
#         sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2, etc)
#     Example:
#        [[[Linear]]]
#            0 = "['2010-01-01 00:00','2011-01-01 00:00',1.0,0.0]"
#     Syntax rules for [[Linear]]:
#         1) each linear correction must be on a separate line and must have a unique

#
# [[CorrectWindDirection]]
#     Purpose:
