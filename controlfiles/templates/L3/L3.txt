# AAHYWEH
# Control file for L2 (input) to L3 (output) quality control.
#
# TEMPLATE VERSION
#  To convert this template to a version that works for data output by the standard OzFlux
#  data logger program:
#   1) Replace the following place holders with values for your site:
#      <site_name> - the name of the site
#      <year>      - the year of the data
#      <latitude>  - the latitude of the site, decimal degrees
#      <longitude> - the longitude of the site, decimal degrees
#      <height>    - the height of the measurement (above ground), m
#      <depth>     - the depth of the measurement (below ground), cm for depths <= 1m, m for depths > 1m
#      <letter>    - the letter used to distinguish sensors at the same depth or height
#   2) Replace the default quality control limits (eg Lower, Upper etc) with site-specific values.
#
# [General]   - general settings
#    PlotWidth               = 10.7          # default plot width, inches
#    PlotHeight              = 8             # default plot height, inches
#    zms                     = <height>      # height of EC instruments above the surface, m
# [Files]     - contains paths and file names
# [Options]   - specify processing options
#             - the following 2 switches must be present with one of the 2 possible values indicated
#    CO2Units                = umol/mol      # 'mg/m3' or 'umol/mol', units for Cc
#    FcUnits                 = umol/m2/s     # 'mg/m2/s' or 'umol/m2/s', units for Fc
#             - the following switches control processing options
#               - defaults as indicated, options are listed after the # symbol
#               - default values are used if these switches are not present
#    UseL2Fluxes             = No            # Yes/No, use fluxes from L2 file, do not calculate fluxes from covariances

#    MassmanCorrection       = No            # Yes/No, apply the Massman correction
#    ApplyFcStorage          = No            # Yes/No, correct Fc for storage, single point

#    CorrectFgForStorage     = Yes           # Yes/No, correct Fg for storage in soil column above sensor
#    CoordinateFluxGaps      = No            # Yes/No, remove Fh and Fe when Fc missing and vice versa
#    CoordinateAh7500&FcGaps = No            # Yes/No, remove Fc data when any Li-7500 missing and vice versa
#             - the following switches are for advanced users only

# [Output]    - specify the variables to be written to the output file
#               - 2 output list can be specified:
#                 - "xl" defines which variables will be written to the Excel file output at L3
#                 - "nc" defines which variables will be written to the netCDF file output at L3
#               - if no list is specified, all variables are written out
# [Soil]      - constants used in correcting Fg for storage
# [Variables] - variable names and quality control keys, only those variables
#               corrected or calculated at this level need to be specified in
#               this control file.
#               Valid quality control sections are:
#                RangeCheck   - reject data less than "Lower" or greater than "Upper"
#                DiurnalCheck - reject data outside Avg(H.h)+/-NumSd*Stdev(H.h) where
#                                Avg(H.h) is the average of all data at time H.h and
#                                Stdev(H.h) is the standard deviation of all data at time H.h
#                                 eg H.h = 8.5 is 0830
#                 NOTE: The "Lower", "Upper" and "NumSd" keywords require a value for each
#                       month of the year (12).  This can be written in shorthand as:

#                       or in longhand as:
#                        eg "[100,110,120,130,140,150,150,140,130,120,110,100]" (different each month)

#                               specified on separate lines but the lines must be numbered
#                               sequentially from 0 (eg 0, 1, 2 etc)
