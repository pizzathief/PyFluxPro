PyFluxPro: Things to fix

Climatology
1) fix climatology
   - change 3x3 tile for smarter way of dealing with edges

L4
1) alternate fit statistics written to file after each manual run
   - fixed 2017-06-25 but not fully tested
2) do OLS fit when plotted even if number filled is 0
3) include lag in statistics on alternate plot
4) trap start datetime >= end datetime when doing manual runs
5) crash at US-Mpj for 2016-07-01 to 2016-07-04 manual run
16:53:36 INFO  Gap fill with alternate: US-Mpj for 2016-07-01 to 2016-10-01

ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (0,) (1510,)
6) do precipitation as cumulative over period
7) do WD as components
8) plot alernate statistics
9) QC of ISD and ERAI data

Anne's list
1) merge EP and PFP fluxes
   - we want to retain ability to pick out only Fc_EP and Fc_EP_QC = 0 or 0/1
     - can be done with existing code as long as Fc_EP and Fc_EP_QC are in output file
   - QC EP fluxes at L2 using EP QC flags
   - QC PFP covariances at L2 and fluxes at L3 using standard PFP QC checks
   - merge EP and PFP fluxes at L3: Fc_EC = merge(Fc_EP,Fc_PFP)
     - EP flux missing and QC flag missing ==> use PFP fluxes (ignores EP QC flag)
     - EP flux present but EP QC flag missing ==> use PFP fluxes
     - EP flux present but EP QC flag = 2 ==> don't use PFP flux, set merged flux to -9999, set PFP QC flag to ?
     - EP flux present but EP QC flag = 1 or 0 ==> use EP flux, set PFP QC flag to ?
     - EP flux present but EP QC flag = 0 ==> use EP flux, set PFP QC flag to ?
       - give user ability to accept EP fluxes
         - if EP QC flag = 0
           if EP QC flag = 0,1
           if EP QC flag = 0,1,2
       - gap filling fluxes should be able to use only EP fluxes or merged EP and PFP fluxes
         - requires specifying target in L5 control file
     - PFP QC flag must be different for each case



2) handling storage
   - Fc_profile QC at L2
     - using profile QC flag read in at L1
     - using range check
   - merge Fc_profile and Fc_single to Fc_storage
   - calculate NEE = Fc_EC + Fc_storage
               Fc = Fc_EC + Fc_storage
     - replaces qcts.CorrectFcForStorage()

3) multiple sources for NEE
   - Fc
   - Fc+Fc_storge
   - Fc_EP
   - Fc_EP+Fc_storage
   
   
Peter
1) implement AddSeries at L3
   - done
   - not implemented as AddSeries but qcts.CorrectFcForStorage()
2) rename Fc_storage in existing PFP to Fc_single
   - done
3) mask merged Fc when EP QC flag = 2 but not when EP QC flag = -9999
   - done
   - implemented as new QC check EPQCFlagCheck
4) implement target = in L5 control file
   - done
5) implement output file name in custom climatology and CPD control files
   used for batch processing
   - done

Anne
1) push 1 path through using Fc=Fc_EC+Fc_storage
   - requires Peter to do 1), 2) and 3) above
2) either push all paths through GUI
   or     set up multiple control files for batch processing
